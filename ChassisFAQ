Question
I saw a red blinking LED from “ i ” icon on the front panel control. What does it stand for and what does it mean?
Answer
The “ i ” means system information and it can be either RED or BLUE LED. 

Solid Red : Overheat 
Blink Red (quick) : Fan fail 
Blink Red (slow) : Power fail 
Solid Blue : Local UID 
Blink Blue (quick): Remote UID 


Based on your server with red LED blinking, you might have either Fan or power failure.
